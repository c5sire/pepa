\description{
Explain the results of the Pesek-Baker index in plain English.
}
\details{
The Pesek-Baker is an index where relative economic weights have been replaced
by desired gains.

By default a model with components for genotypes, environments, genotypes by environments
interaction and replications nested into environments is fitted (\code{model = "gxe"}).
If \code{model = "g+e"} then a model with components for genotypes
and environments is fitted, and in this case the gxe variance includes the gxe plus the
error variance. Response to selection is only computed when \code{model = "gxe"}.

If \code{means = "fitted"} then the model specified in \code{model} is used to fit
the means of the genotypes. Otherwise single arithmetic means are computed over the
replications for each genotype at each environment and then for each genotype over environments.

If \code{dgg} is not specified, the standard deviations of the traits are used.
It means that the desired genetic gains are equal to one standard deviation for
each trait. \code{dgg} can be specified in actual units (\code{units = "actual"}) or in
standard deviations (\code{units = "sdu"}), defaults to \code{"sdu"}. For example,
if you have a trait which is expressed in kilograms and with a standard deviation of
5 kilograms, typing \code{dgg = 2} means a desired genetic gain of 2 standard deviations
that corresponds to 10 kilograms. If you type \code{dgg = 2} and \code{units = "actual"}
then this means a desired genetic gain of 2 kilograms. If \code{dgg = NULL} then the
desired genetic gain will be one standard deviation, no matter if \code{units} is set
as \code{"actual"} or \code{"sdu"}.
